#  Kickoff Meeting Mandatory

The kick-off meeting for the integration process is mandatory because it
serves as a crucial foundation for successful collaboration, enabling you to
align with us about your objectives, expectations, and timelines.

This initial meeting ensures that everyone involved is on the same page and
establishes a clear roadmap for the integration, ultimately saving time,
reducing misunderstandings, and setting the integration process up for
success.
