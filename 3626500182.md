#  Firas.Hachem : FinalDescription of Hubject HBS + EV Charging Ecosystem

Created by  Stefania Sau on Jan 12, 2024

The Hubject HBS (Hubject Brokering System) is a central component of the EV
(Electric Vehicle) Charging Ecosystem. It serves as a platform that connects
charging point operators (CPOs) with Emobility Service Providers (EMPs) to
enable seamless communication, billing, and access for electric vehicle users.
The HBS acts as a bridge, facilitating interoperability among diverse charging
infrastructure, ensuring that EV drivers can locate, access, and pay for
charging services easily. In essence, it plays a vital role in unifying and
streamlining the complex network of EV charging stations, making electric
vehicle adoption more convenient and efficient for both businesses and users.
