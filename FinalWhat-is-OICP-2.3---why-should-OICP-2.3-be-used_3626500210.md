#  Firas.Hachem : FinalWhat is OICP 2.3 - why should OICP 2.3 be used

Created by  Stefania Sau on Jan 12, 2024

OICP 2.3, or Open InterCharge Protocol version 2.3, is a standardized protocol
that underpins communication within the electric vehicle (EV) charging
industry. It is designed to create a common language for different
stakeholders, such as CPOs and EMPs, ensuring seamless and efficient
communication and data exchange. By using OICP 2.3, organizations in the EV
charging ecosystem can achieve interoperability, making it easier for users to
access and use charging services while promoting efficiency and transparency.
