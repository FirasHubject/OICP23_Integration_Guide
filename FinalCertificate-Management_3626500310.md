#  Firas.Hachem : FinalCertificate Management

Created by  Stefania Sau on Jan 12, 2024

In the Certificate Management section, you have the option to upload your user
certificates, which are required for establishing communication from HBS to
your backend system. Note that this step is not required if you are using the
Hubject CA root certificates. In such cases, you only need to add these root
certificates to your trust store, and you will be ready to proceed.

We strongly recommend using the Hubject CA as it saves time on your end and
the Expiration Dates are 10 years, compared to other User Certificates which
have a validity of only two years.
