 # FinalPre-requisites: Preparing your system, Questionnaires, IP Whitelisting, CSR

For a seamless integration, you will have to fulfill prerequisites. Your
Hubject Onboarding Manager will provide you with a Business Questionnaire and
a Technical Questionnaire. The filled-out information will be used to create
your account on our Platform and to allow collaboration with EMPs and Hubject.

For an integration with Hubject, it is crucial to provide us with your static
IP Addresses as this is how we verify that the network is coming from a secure
network.
