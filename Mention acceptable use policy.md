# Mention acceptable use policy (including Throttling):


Thousands of requests go through the HBS every day. In order to have a stable
and healthy system, we have created an Acceptable Use Policy. This policy will
provide you a guideline on the requestâ€™s frequency to be made from your system
to the HBS.
