#  Firas.Hachem : FinalBrief explanation on what eRoaming is

Created by  Stefania Sau on Jan 12, 2024

eRoaming, short for "electric vehicle roaming," is a system that enables
seamless access and interoperability between different charging networks for
electric vehicles (EVs). It allows EV drivers to use a single access card,
app, or payment method to charge their vehicles at charging stations operated
by various network providers. eRoaming simplifies the charging experience for
EV users, making it easier to locate and utilize charging infrastructure
across different regions or countries, ultimately promoting the widespread
adoption of electric vehicles.
